# Engineering Design 2020 - Team Dynamics
Progress from the 2018, 2019, 2020 teams of UChicago MENG students working on the Spray Dynamics team for the Engineering Design course sequence (Capstone Project). In this project, we are aiming to extract 3D profiles from 2D monochromatic x-ray images taken of high velocity / high pressure fuel sprays. 

Here, we created 3D objects in AutoDesk 3ds Max, slice the objects, and then calculate 3D profiles. In addition, we attempt to parallelize the algorithms being implemented. We also read in a .mat file as data to be looked at but given the file takes up more than 1 GB, we did not upload the data file.
